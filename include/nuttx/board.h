/****************************************************************************
 * Name: board_led_initialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   This functions is called very early in initialization to perform board-
 *   specific initialization of LED-related resources.  This includes such
 *   things as, for example, configure GPIO pins to drive the LEDs and also
 *   putting the LEDs in their correct initial state.
 *
 *   In most architectures, board_led_initialize() is called fromo board-
 *   specific initialization logic.  But there are a few architectures where
 *   this initialization function is called from shared chip logic.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   None
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   None

 * Name: board_led_on
 *
 * Description:
 *   Set the LED configuration into the ON condition for the state provided
 *   by the led parameter.  This may be one of:
 *
 *     LED_STARTED       NuttX has been started
 *     LED_HEAPALLOCATE  Heap has been allocated
 *     LED_IRQSENABLED   Interrupts enabled
 *     LED_STACKCREATED  Idle stack created
 *     LED_INIRQ         In an interrupt
 *     LED_SIGNAL        In a signal handler
 *     LED_ASSERTION     An assertion failed
 *     LED_PANIC         The system has crashed
 *     LED_IDLE          MCU is in sleep mode
 *
 *   Where these values are defined in a board-specific way in the standard
 *   board.h header file exported by every architecture.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   led - Identifies the LED state to put in the ON state (which may or may
 *         not equate to turning an LED on)
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   None
